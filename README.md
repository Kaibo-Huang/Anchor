# Anchor

**Elevator Pitch:** Turn any footage into your personal brand

## Inspiration

Branding builds identity. Whether you're a high school athlete creating a recruitment tape, a band promoting your concert, or a school showcasing your graduation, that perfect video tells your story.

But here's the problem: professional video editing is intimidating and expensive. Parents at school events are recording from multiple angles with their phones, but those raw clips just sit in camera rolls. Athletes have game footage but don't know how to stitch them together and promote their brand sponsors. Organizations want to promote their events but can't afford a videographer.

Meanwhile, professional sports broadcasts make multi-angle switching look seamless, but that requires expensive equipment and trained editors.

We asked ourselves: What if AI could do this automatically? What if anyone with phone footage could create broadcast-quality recaps? And what if those videos could actually generate revenue through seamless sponsorships?

That's why we built Anchor. We want to democratize professional video editing and help anyone amplify their identity through powerful visual storytelling.

## What it does

Anchor transforms multi-angle footage into broadcast-quality reels with integrated sponsorships—automatically, with your prompt.

Here's how it works:

1. **Upload Your Footage**: Capture your event from multiple angles. Upload videos to Anchor with different camera shots, and tell us what type of event it is.

2. **Add Your Personal Touch**: Upload your team anthem, graduation song, or favorite track. This is your identity—your music makes the reel uniquely yours.

3. **Tell Us What You Want**: Just describe your vision in plain English:
   - "Show me my best moments" - Anchor finds YOU across all the footage
   - "Create a high-energy highlight reel" - Get an intense, action-packed edit
   - "Track player #23, focus on scoring plays" - Follow a specific person, emphasize key moments
   - "Make me a 30-second teaser for Instagram" - Get the perfect length for social media

4. **Watch the Magic Happen**: Anchor's AI takes over:
   - Automatically syncs all your videos to the same timeline (no more "which angle had the best shot?")
   - Intelligently switches between angles like a professional broadcast director
   - Syncs scene changes to the beat drops of your music
   - Integrates sponsor ads that look like TV commercials, not annoying popups
