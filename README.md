**Elevator Pitch:** Turn any footage into your personal brand

## Inspiration

Branding builds identity. Whether you're a high school athlete creating a recruitment tape, a band promoting your concert, or a school showcasing your graduation, that perfect video tells your story.

But here's the problem: professional video editing is intimidating and expensive. Parents at school events are recording from multiple angles with their phones, but those raw clips just sit in camera rolls. Athletes have game footage but don't know how to stitch them together and promote their brand sponsors. Organizations want to promote their events but can't afford a videographer.

Meanwhile, professional sports broadcasts make multi-angle switching look seamless, but that requires expensive equipment and trained editors.

We asked ourselves: What if AI could do this automatically? What if anyone with phone footage could create broadcast-quality recaps? And what if those videos could actually generate revenue through seamless sponsorships?

That's why we built Anchor. We want to democratize professional video editing and help anyone amplify their identity through powerful visual storytelling.
